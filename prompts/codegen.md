{{ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS}}

Requirements:
- Try to learn about the code from the repo, committs and PRs, but be mindful not to cross the context length
- If workspace is provided, prefer using that for the same purpose alternatively. 
- If doing any directory scans, try to optimise it
- When searching directories, prefer using ripgrep (`rg`) with hidden files allowed but exclude .git, node_modules, dist, and build. Avoid recursive grep unless no other option is possible.
- If searching by filename, use `fd` or `find` (based on the current os) with exclusions instead of grep.
- Follow repo conventions and tests.
- Generate the code based on Jira requirement. 
- Dont create or update any tests
- Explain the plan briefly, then apply changes.
- Just update the files in the workplace locally
